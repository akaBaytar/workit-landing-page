## Workit Landing Page

In the Workit project, I made an effort to utilize features that browsers started supporting in 2023, which were recently added to CSS.

In the project source code, you can find the features listed below:

- new targeting range syntax added for the viewport
  `@media (720px <= width <= 1200px)`
- nesting structure familiar from SASS
- new functions for creating animations without the need for scripts
  `scroll(), view()`
- the newly added pseudo-selectors
  `:has(), :where(), :is()`
- new syntax for margin, padding, and container
  `margin-block-end, padding-inline etc.`
- responsive typographies created without using the media tag
  `clamp()`
- and many more...
